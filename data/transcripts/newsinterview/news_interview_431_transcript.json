      "text": "On September 26, 2014, students from a teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeered some buses. Their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration. But those buses never arrived. And 43 of the students went missing along the way and were presumed killed in and around the town of Iguala. Although their remains have never been found, their deaths were variously blamed on corrupt local political and police officials, as well as higher-ups in the Mexican military and the government and, of course, the drug gangs. The aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis amid shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations. Now Mexican journalist Anabel Hernandez has published an exhaustive look into the events of that night. Her book is called \"A Massacre In Mexico: The True Story Behind The Missing 43 Students.\" She told us the official version of the events was a fabrication."

      "text": "In this official version, the Mexican government said that the army and the Federal Police - they didn't know anything about what was happening. And they just get notice two or three hours after everything ends. This is the official story. What I have seen all these years - four years of the investigation - is that all this official version is a lie. It's not true."

      "text": "Well, the students arrive near Iguala. The army, the Federal Police, the state police were waiting for them. Then the students decide to move the two buses where they were transportating (ph) inside to the city to be able to take three more buses. The objective was take more buses to go to the protest to Mexico City. So they went to bus station. They took the other three buses. And when the students were trying to escape on board of these five buses from Iguala when the army, the Federal Police, the municipal police and the state police - they start to shoot against the buses to stop them. The objective of the attack were two buses. From these two buses disappeared all the 43 students."

      "text": "So the Federal Police opened fire. People were wounded, injured. And two of the buses - the people that were on those buses, the students who were on those buses disappeared. Why were they targeting this group of students? Why would the Federal Police and the army get involved in this?"

      "text": "Why if the students two were traveling in five buses - why the target was just two? And also, these two buses were exactly the two buses that the army and the Federal Police - start to monitor it since three hours before. I mean, these two buses were the two buses where the students were traveling from the school to Iguala. Why? So what I was able to found is that in these two buses were inside in secret parts of the bus..."

In the middle of my investigation, one of my sources were murdered just in the streets. But I think that this is my job.
