Pence speaks tonight to a convention that's trying to unify around the ticket. But there are still people on the floor who have their doubts. Meet one of them."

      "text": "I think the wall is not the big issue. I think it's what are you going to do with the 11 million people who are here illegally? Mass deportations are a concern. We don't want mass deportations. If he can change to a legalization program which allows people to apply here in the United States at a consulate and not in a foreign government where there's a lot of corruption, I'm willing to go with him with it."

And a lot of those kids I know, they're serving in the military, they're business owners, they're successful and they vote. And whenever you attack immigrants and talk about amnesty, you're talking about them as well. And we're leaving a huge constituency behind simply because of cheap primary politics."

      "speaker": "Artemio Muniz",
      "text": "Well, one thing is I think the Reagan legacy has sort of been tarnished where a lot of people in the conservative echo chamber will only pick and choose what Reagan said. But you also have W. Bush, George W. Bush, who also pushed for immigration reform. And I remember his outreach videos. He would actually stand in parades waving Mexican flags. I can only imagine what would happen if Trump waved the Mexican flag nowadays."

And I know a lot of my friends who are in the campaign who are of like mindset and they are really working towards convincing Donald Trump. And I think, look, he's a businessman. I think he wants to win. I want to win. It's sort of like he's negotiating sort of."

      "speaker": "Robert Siegel",
      "text": "You think he's going to say, OK, here's a plan for 11 million immigrants here illegally. They can go to a consulate in this country, get some papers and apply? You think he can get that through a convention like this and a party like this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Artemio Muniz",
      "text": "I don't think it would be at the convention. I think it'll be later on down the road when he has a chance to really look at things and see if he really wants to go down that road. Now, it's going to be tough because some people in the base will scream amnesty at any solution. But Trump's gifted. If you notice, he can take a position one second, then the other. But he really sells it. And if he believes it, I think that that leadership quality in him will really convince the base."
