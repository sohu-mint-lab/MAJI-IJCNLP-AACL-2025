Tonight, its new and bizarre autopsy details like the fact that he weighed a mere 136 pounds, he was nearly bald and the tip of his nose was missing. Back with me is Judge Jeanine Pirro. Ok, so what about that he was so isolated this guy that nobody noticed that the nose was missing, that there was -- 136 pounds. You know I found out today he was very tall I didn`t realize that."
