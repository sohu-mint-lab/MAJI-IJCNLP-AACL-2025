When someone has a heart attack, blood f2low to the heart muscle is interrupted. That lack of blood can do some serious damage to the heart. Over time, a severely damaged heart just can't keep up, and a heart transplant might be a patient's only hope. But what if that heart muscle could be repaired and blood flow restored, repaired using stem cells? Joining me now to talk more about it is my guest Joshua Hare, cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. He's also the director of the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute there. And he's been trying to use stem cells to repair broken hearts.

The - a heart attack is, in essence, a cessation of blood flow to an area of heart muscle. What happens when that blood flow is abruptly stopped for a period of 20 minutes or greater, the heart muscle cells die, and the healing process is one of scar formation. So similar to the scar you get in your skin when you cut it, a scar like that forms in the heart, and it's intended to repair the damage. But of course scar tissue isn't like muscle, and so the scar can't contract, and permanent damage is caused to the heart muscle.
