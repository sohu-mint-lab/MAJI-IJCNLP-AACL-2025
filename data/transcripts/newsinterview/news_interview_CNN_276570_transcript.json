Don't forget, I only have three days to fight it. I don't have like a period of six months. So we will bring a lawsuit if he doesn't straighten his act out. He's a really lying guy, a really lying guy. Some people misrepresent. This guy's just a plain liar. In fact, I felt better because Marco Rubio called him a liar the other night on stage. I felt so much better. I said, good, a politician called a politician. Now I can actually call him a liar. Let's go. Go ahead."

      "text": "This is a different reason. This is for Gitmo. And it's really originally for Gitmo, but you folks haven't asked that question yet, because it's ridiculous they're moving people in that area and we're totally against it. And if I win, we're moving them out. And they shouldn't be closing Gitmo, Guantanamo Bay. They shouldn't be closing it in any way, shape or form. And they shouldn't be moving people, hardened criminals into this area. I will stop it. If I don't stop it in terms of time, if I win, they're going back. I'd keep it open. Yeah, I'd keep it open. That's right, I'd keep it open. We have to be very vigilant. We'll look at everybody's case certainly. And you don't want to have people that are innocent of something, suffering. But you have some very hardened people. You've let a lot of people go. He's letting them go one after the other. Many are going back to the battlefields. You've seen what happened, they're going right back into the battlefields. So we want to keep it open, and that's the way I feel. And I don't want -- and here's the thing. I don't want people coming into this area. And I've had such complaints. I've had people from South Carolina calling me asking me to do this press conference about Guantanamo Bay. And there's not going to be any people coming here. And frankly, I think the governor should take a very strong stand on it. Eventually, yeah, eventually. Eventually, they should. I would increase the population. As we capture other people that are terrorists and the like, I would absolutely increase. I would be very strong on it, yes. Well, the governor has a lot of people that people don't realize. A governor is -- for instance, with the migration, you have people coming into the area of South Carolina. They're coming in. If I were the governor, I wouldn't let them come in. I don't care what the rules and regulations say. In theory, the governor doesn't have anything to do with it. I would have something to do with it, believe me. I would make it so uncomfortable for the federal government that they'll say, OK, send them to other states or let's no take them in period. We shouldn't be taking people in from the migration. We shouldn't be taking people in from Syria, because we don't know who they are. We don't know where they come from. You look at what's going on in Sweden and Germany and all these other countries, we should not be taking people in from the migration. Now, we should help people with safe zones in Syria. We should get -- I will get the Gulf States to pay for it, because right now they're paying for nothing and they're taking nobody. Because they're smart. You know what, they're smart. But they'll pay. And we're not going to pay. We'll lead it, but we should build safe zones because you have to do something. But I don't want to take people into this country. You saw what happened in California with two people that got married that were radicalized and it was a disaster, OK, a disaster. They killed 14. Plenty of people laying right now in the hospital. You look at what's going on right now in the world, we're not going to do it. We have enough problems as a country. You take a look at what's going on in Germany. Look at what's going on in Brussels. Look what's going on in Sweden the other night. We're not going to have that. I don't say anything. I'm just saying this, if you look back at your record, you'll see there was tremendous information and the CIA and various other agencies were not talking and they were not getting along and there were a lot of personality conflicts and they all hated each other and we ended up with the World Trade Center, OK. If you look at the book, \"The America We Deserve,\" written in the year 2000, I mentioned in that book -- me, I wrote it. I mentioned in that book \"Osama bin Laden,\" because I saw him a couple of times and I read about him, and I said, you know, he's a bad dude, we better do something about him. Now, I wasn't even a politician. I wasn't in politics. I just always found it very interesting. I'm saying to myself, we better do something about that guy. Why wouldn't -- if you did something about him, you wouldn't have the World Trade Center come down. But if you look back at the CIA and the various other agencies -- and I think John is not nodding. I don't know if you remember it. But they had tremendous problems getting along together. That's management. Because if they did, they knew what was going -- they knew some bad things were going to happen. They could have stopped it. Go ahead. I don't say it was anything. I just say the World -- I don't say anything. Here's what I say. Are you ready? The World Trade Center came down during his reign. So, you know, it's like he was the top. The World Trade Center came down. Well, the war with Iraq, which started this whole thing, the whole thing starts with the war in Iraq. You know, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy. One thing about him, he killed terrorists. Now Iraq is harbored for terrorism. You want to become a terrorist, you go to Iraq. Saddam Hussein understood, and he killed terrorists. Bad guy. But if the president and other people -- and, frankly, Obama, was no better, because the way he got us out was a disaster. Look what's happened since then. A disaster. Shouldn't have been there. Shouldn't have got out the way we got out. But if the president went to the beach, we would have been better off, believe me. John, go ahead. No, I think we could have had greater vigilance but I would never say anybody is responsible for that. Say hello to him for me. Give him my warmest records regards. No, no, look, this is -- Me? No. Look,look, look, actually, no. When was this set up, I have no idea. This was set up for Guantanamo. No, not really. I compare it to Bill Clinton. So Bill Clinton came out four weeks ago and his wife made a statement about me having to do with sexism, right. And I made a statement about her and him. And I said once she made that statement and once he was campaigning, it's a whole different ball game. Now, if the ex-president is campaigning for his brother, I think he's probably open to great scrutiny. Maybe things that haven't been thought of in the past. You know, when Jeb used his name, as I said in the first debate, in the Reagan debate, I left it alone. But when he kept using it, I said, I have to bring it up. When he talked about the great safety we had. I said, I'm sorry, at some point, we have to bring it up. The other day, I brought it up. I said the World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign. I don't think anything can hurt him. He's doing so badly, how much worse can he be hurt, you know? Delay, delay, yes. I wouldn't draw the line. Hey, I don't blame Obama. He's going to try to do it. I don't think he could be successful because Mitch McConnell has tremendous power in terms of the delay and in terms of, you know, proceedings, et cetera. The time is not that long. It's what, 11 months, 10 months. So it's not -- no, but it's not that much. I'm not saying that Obama shouldn't do it. I'm just saying the Republicans should not allow it to happen. Now, I also said the Republicans should not have approved the budget they approved four weeks ago, and they approached the budget. So you never know. I mean, they've been very disappointing. The Republicans have been very, very disappointing. I always say that Obama is the worst negotiator I've ever seen with everybody but the Republicans. I think what is going to happen is they'll put in somebody who is probably a little more moderate than he would have normally done. I still think the Republicans should reject. I think the new president should have that option. Tom, go ahead. I'm not the first. I said from the beginning. I said from the beginning, Tom. Tells me nothing about him, actually. I think the name Bush would have than an exclamation point. He's Jeb Bush. The exclamation point didn't work, so now he's using Bush. But I think he should have used his name. I think it shows he wasn't proud of the family. I don't know exactly what it tells you. I would tell him, why don't you use the name Bush? You're Bush. Use the name Bush. Oh, yeah. Look, if you look at the year -- you can play cute. Who are you, by the way? OK. Let me tell you, Jim, you can play cute. In 2003 -- Excuse me. I'll tell you why it's cute, because I said many things for a long time, but I wasn't a politician so I didn't get any publicity by saying about it. I said for a long time don't go into the war, don't go into the war. I think the first time they have me down, you probably have it as 2003. This is shortly like right after the war started. Somebody actually said it doesn't make any difference because, early on, I said it. I was saying it before then, too. In 2003, right at the beginning, I said it, and very strongly. In 2004, I was in Reuters and quoted all over the place because I was opposed to the war. Very simple. I said you're going to destabilize the Middle East. Right now, you have two powers, Iraq and Iran, equal in terms of military strength. If you knock out one of those powers, the other one will take over the Middle East. That's exactly what happened. Now I didn't know we'd be so stupid to make a deal where we give them $150 billion, which we just gave them. But now they have $150 billion. A very wonderful agreement with us in terms of -- you know they went out and they're spending their $150 billion. So far they haven't spent any of it with us. They bought 118 aircraft from Air Bus, which is European. They're spending their money all over Europe. They're buying missiles from Russia. They're spending their money with everybody but the United States. Not good. Not good. Well, I'll tell you, I went to the debate and I was attacked. If I didn't -- if I wasn't attacked -- I thought it was my best debate. Some people agree. Some people thought I was too tough. I thought it was my best debate. But I was being attacked from everybody. It was the incoming. It was unbelievable. I was looking around. Including the moderator because they're saying Donald Trump said this and this about your brother. That's how the whole thing started. That Donald Trump said and, you know, in ancient times, so and so about your bother. I didn't bring it up. That was brought up by John as you know. So I didn't bring it up. So I was being attacked by the moderators from the standpoint that they were feeding -- it was like a feeding frenzy on Trump. That's why they got good ratings. They got very good ratings. I think I'm doing great in South Carolina. I think the South Carolina voters -- I know South Carolina very well. I've been here a lot. I think they have a very sophisticated voter. And they get it. They get it. For instance, when Cruz lies about virtually everything I've done, they get it. I really believe they get it. We'll soon find out. Well, actually, I'm doing a favor by filing. The Democrats are going to file it anyway. Just so you understand. You don't think I get along -- I get along with everybody. I was a business guy, got along with everybody. The Democrats -- if Cruz ever got it -- I don't think he's going to get the -- I think I'm going to get it. But if Cruz ever got the nomination, the Democrats are going to follow the lawsuit. In a sense, I'm doing him a favor because I'm filing it early. If I file it, I'm filing it early. But I have a very good lawyer, already hired. I have a very good lawyer and a lawyer that truly believes -- remember this, how do you give a man the nomination for your major party, one of the two major parties, and the man has a cloud over his head? And I told him, get a declaratory judgment. You've got to do something. The Democrats are going to file. To the best of my knowledge, there are already two lawsuits out there. No, no, no. Look, eventually, it's going to be used anyway. They're going to sue him. If he got the nomination -- they're not going to sue him now because they don't think he's going to get the nomination. But if he got the nomination, he's going to be sued. So frankly, if I were him, I'd probably tell him, if I was advising him, other than I'm more moral than he is, in my opinion, I would probably tell him very nicely, keep your lies going, you're going to get sued. You're going to get sued anyway, might as well keep your lies going. But let's see what happens. I think it's a good lawsuit. So am What does that mean he kept the country safe after 9/11? In other words, we had this major catastrophe and after that. What does that mean? I don't know. See, I've heard that for years. I've heard that for years, Jeremy. I've heard that for years he kept the country safe after 9/11. What does that mean, after? What about during 9/11? I was there. I lost a lot friends that were killed in that building. The worst attack ever in this country? It was during his presidency. We had the worse attack ever. By the way, after that, we did OK. That's meaning the team scored 19 runs in the first inning, but after that, we played well. I don't think so. Well, I don't know. I think we're doing well. I've been around. We have a tremendous rally tonight. I'm here for the entire week. You mean by the fact that I'm here? Give me a break. You have a situation here where people from Syria are being settled in South Carolina. And I think it's disgraceful. And if I were Nikki Haley, I would not allow it to happen, I tell you right now. I would not allow it to happen. She'll say we have no choice. A governor has choice, believe me. I don't know what you're talking about. Go ahead. Well, I'm responding -- in all fairness, I'm responding. Me? I think I deal with pressure well. I've won many club championships. You have to deal with pressure. I deal with pressure. That's all I do. My whole life has been pressure. I like pressure. I really do like pressure. But I don't think Cruz deals well with pressure. I think he's a basket case. He thought he was going to win New Hampshire and he lost. Not only did he lose, he lost badly. Does not handle pressure well. I don't think Rubio handles pressure well. You saw that in his run-in with Christie. I was standing next to Rubio and I thought he just got out of a swimming pool. He was soaking wet. I don't think he handles pressure well. I don't see him negotiating -- look, I don't see that personality negotiating with Putin like this personality, OK. You want to make a good deal for the country, you want to deal with Russia -- and there's nothing wrong with not fighting everybody, having Russia where we have a good relationship as opposed to all the stupidity that's taken place. But I'm going to make the great trade deals. I'm going to make the great deals. These guys aren't going to make them. They're politicians. I think it's -- look, I think everything's a pressure cooker. You have to handle pressure. That's what I like doing. I love the pressure. But you can't lie. You can't allow lies to take place, like where Cruz is saying with guns, with Bush, and with this, and virtually everything. It's just a lie. Somebody has to say it. I find the whole South Carolina thing so interesting. I find the people --- you know, we're already had a couple of events today. I find the people amazing. They're amazing. The one thing that's really interesting, they're very knowledgeable politically in South Carolina. I think that's a good thing for me. They understand politicians. They understand they're all talk, no action. They're not going to make deals. Look, I'm the only politician that's not getting any money. All these guys, like Cruz, getting tremendous money from oil and all these different -- Jeb Bush. Woody Johnson, from Johnson & Johnson, is his campaign, you know, finance chairman. Woody totally controls what happens. You think the drug industry is going to be hurt by Jeb Bush when Woody Johnson is the head of his committee raising funds for him? The drug comes, basically, there's no bidding. If we bid out -- we're the largest purchaser of drugs in the world that make you better. The largest in the world. The drug companies, there's no bidding. You know why there's no bidding? Because the politicians all take money from the drug moneys, campaign contributions. I don't know if you guys can figure that out. They take money from the drug companies. Same with everything. Me, I'm not taking any money. I'll do what's right. I'll do what's right for the people. I will have spent a lot money by the time it's over. I don't know if that point is making made very importantly, John. Does somebody say \"I love Trump because he's not taking money from the special interests or the lobbyists?\" I don't know. But we'll soon find out. What? We're going to see. I'm going to look at a lot of things. What I see so far is unbelievable. That somebody can go and do what they're doing and make statements like that. Don't forget, I've been doing this since June 16th. I learned so much from Iowa. When somebody can be so dishonest. When I saw -- and I know you people covered the Ben Carson thing. But to me, what was worse was the \"voter violation form.\" This thing looked like it was made -- came right out of the IRS. The paper, the look. It looked like a government document. It said \"voter violation, you are in violation.\" So anyway, I'll be looking. Yeah, go ahead. Very good reporter. By the way, very good reporter, this guy. Go ahead. Well, they defaulted. Look, I'm very disappointed in the RNC. The Republican National Committee, right. I'm very disappointed in the RNC because, for three debates now, the room has been stacked with special interest and donors, as you know, as the press knows. As an example, I gave two judges who were very conservative judges -- I was met with nice applause, you know. Bush got up and stumbled through an answer and the place went crazy. I said what are they doing? Then I realized all of these -- and many of the people -- I have to say, it's sort funny, but many of the people in the room I know. Some are friends to me. Some are waving and booing and they're having fun. I'm laughing. You know, I get it. But some of them are friends of mine. They're special interests, they're lobbyists, and that shouldn't be. They have total control over the people I'm running against. Total absolute control. I bring up the drug thing because the drug companies are going to go to competitive bid. Whether we save $100 billion a year or $350 billion a year, they're going to competitive bid. These people can't say that, because the drug companies give them a fortune to run for office. OK. Tom? Too many. Well, no, not the dirtiest. He's the biggest liar. I've seen some that are much more cunning because you wouldn't catch them. This guy lies but he got caught every time. He got caught with Carson. The good ones are ones who can do it and they don't get caught. If Ted Cruz did it and didn't get caught. He got caught with \"voter violation.\" He got caught with stuff in New Hampshire. We caught him here with robo-calls. He's making robo-calls. They're doing a poll and they're saying Donald Trump is a horrible human being, bah, bah, bah, bah, and Ted Cruz is wonderful, what about Ted Cruz. What they're doing is -- you know, you know what it is, push pulse. We caught him. The really good ones are the ones who don't get caught. Every time he ever did anything, he got caught. But if you catch him and don't do anything about him, then it's your fault, OK. The what? Very simple. Great borders. We'll going to build a wall. By the way, Mexico's going to pay for the wall. These people say Mexico's not going to pay for the wall. Of course, they are. We lose so much money with Mexico in terms of deficit. We have a deficit with Mexico. That's so massive. They're going to pay for the wall. The wall is peanuts. Trust me, they're going to pay for the wall. But we're going to have a strong military. We're going to take care of our vets, so important. We were going to end Obamacare. It's going to be terminated. We're going to come up with something very good. Whether it's -- I mean, look, there's so many different plans. Now, part of the problem with the plans are the insurance companies dictated the plans to Obama. Insurance companies are making a fortune, some of them, with Obamacare. We're going to come up with a savings, you know -- you can do the health care savings plan. We're going to get rid of the boundaries around the states where it makes it totally non- competitive. So we're getting rid of Obamacare. We're repealing and replacing Obamacare. Common Core is absolutely going to -- it's dead, it's the worse. We're number 30 in the world in education. You have Norway, Sweden, China, Denmark, you have these countries. We're number 30. We spend more per pupil. So Common Core is dead. We're getting rid of Common Core. We're going to protect our Second Amendment. When I say dead, we're going to protect our Second Amendment and et cetera, OK. We're not going to let people come here from Guantanamo Bay. We are not letting people come to this area from Guantanamo Bay. You're talking about the local, local. We're going to let people come to this area from Guantanamo Bay. They're going to stay where they are right now. They're not coming to the country, let alone this area. But they're not coming to this area. And if they do come to this area before election time, before we take office, and I take office, they're going back. You can tell that to the local people, OK. You can bank on it. Winning South Carolina will be a great thing, I agree. I will tell you that I have received so many calls from people that you all know about and you write about and speak viciously about me when they want to come on board, OK. They're politicians. I've received so many calls. You can speak to Corey. We're not going to give you names anyway. But, Corey, is that a correct statement, to put it mildly? I've received so many calls. The most unsuspected people. John Holloway will say there's no way, there's no way that guy called. They called. People that you would not believe. It's all going to come together. I'm a unifier. People -- I'm not going to say that. I'm a unifier. Obama is not a unifier, by the way. I'm a unifier. I hope so. You know, look, we're working hard and we have a great relationship with the people of South Carolina. I hope it holds. You know, I can't tell you what's going to happen when a guy lies. When a guy lies about your record. That's why you have to get the truth out. But I think -- I think we should hold. I hope we're going to hold. I hope we're going to be successful. My whole theme is \"Make America great again.\" South Carolina's going to have a big part in that, because South Carolina -- I mean, you know, this could be the start. And maybe running the table. I say run the table. I think if we win South Carolina, we could conceivably run the table. We'll do very well. Oh, sure. I think they will anyway. I think you'll have certain people get out of the race. I think it would be better for him if he stayed out. No. I think I'm giving a rally. I'll see what happens. But I don't believe I'll be able to because I think I'm giving a rally at that time. Am I? Yes, I'm giving a rally. Weak, period. Yeah. Sure, I think it's great. You know what I want? I want dreamers to come from this country, OK. You mention dreamers -- Wait, you mentioned dreamers. I want dreamers to come from the United States. I want the people in the United States that have children, I want them to have dreams also. We're always talking about dreamers for other people. I want the children that are growing up in the United States to be dreamers also. They're not dreaming right now. And you look at African-American youth, I mean, 58 percent unemployment. You look at African-Americans and they're 30 years old and they're 40 years old, and we have an African-American president, and he has not done anything for the African-Americans in this country, OK. And he got a free pass. And he shouldn't have. Because if that were me or if that was somebody else, we would be -- we would be taking other the calls, believe me. It would not be a good situation. President Obama has done nothing for African-Americans. You look at African-Americans youth, if you look at African-Americans that are 30 years old, 40 years old, 50, in their prime, their prime, and take a look at their statistics, it's very sad. OK, how about one or two more questions. Yes, sir, go ahead. What? I'll look at it. Excuse me, that's enough. About Cuba? I think after 50 years, it's time, but we have to make a much better deal than we're making. We make bad deals. It's like the Keystone Pipeline. I'm totally in favor of it. But I have to get -- it's going to make a fortune, the Keystone Pipeline. By the way, we're using eminent domain. And if you noticed, an article came out today that Bush used private eminent domain in Florida, knocked out a veteran, disabled veteran. He was talking about private eminent domain, how horrible. But came out two major stories about him using private -- I mean, he just doesn't understand that, you know, things like that. But, but the Keystone Pipeline, I will -- the Keystone Pipeline, but I will make a deal for this country where we get a chunk of it. Through eminent domain, we make the Keystone Pipeline and other things possible. They're going to make tremendous amounts of money from the Keystone Pipeline. A lot of the money they make is going to come back to the people of this country. You understand what I mean. John? Lies. My only worry about South Carolina is that my opponents lie, especially Cruz. I mean, Cruz -- as I said, he's the single worst liar I've ever seen. If people believe the lies, then, you know, we won't make America great again because nobody else is going to be able to do it but me, believe me. I --"
