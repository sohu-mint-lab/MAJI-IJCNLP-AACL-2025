So as you rightly pointed out, I've been commentating on soccer matches for 34 years now. I started when I was at university as a teenager. But you do get to a stage where you're recognizing that you're covering an event or a storyline for the fifth, sixth, seventh, maybe eighth time. And I just got to the stage where, in 2014, ESPN hired me to cover the World Cup in Brazil. And off the back of that, the suggestion was made that maybe I'd like to consider, at some point, coming and making my home here and commentating full time on American soccer rather than European or, specifically, British soccer. And that was the gestation, really, of an idea that took four years to grow into a fully fledged offer to come in and work here full time.",

So one of the attractions of this job coming now, for me, is that if you look at the context of league soccer in this country, it began, effectively, in 1996. So this is season number 24 that begins over this weekend. If you translate that into the English game, league soccer there started in 1888. So, in the same terms, we're in 1911 now, here in America.

It's quite attractive to come and be a little part of trying to tell the story of a growth of a sport that's conquered the world with one exception, and we're sitting right in the middle of that exception. And I'd love to play a very, very small role and be a close observer of the breakthrough of soccer. I'm not suggesting that it's going to displace the NFL, but it is capable of nibbling at the heels, perhaps, of baseball and of ice hockey, certainly. It's very exciting to be at the stage of one's career where one's been lucky enough to do most things, but this is an unconquered frontier.",
