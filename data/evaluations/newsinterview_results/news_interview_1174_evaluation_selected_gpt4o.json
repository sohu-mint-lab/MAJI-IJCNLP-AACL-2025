She went on to become on of the 1970's best loved artist with classics like the tune \"At Seventeen.\" But the impact of \"Society's Child\" has stayed with her to this day. It's the title of her recently released autobiography. I asked Janis Ian to share the story behind the \"Society's Child\" and how she came to write a song with so much insight at age 13.",
            "previous_answer": "I was one of I think three white girls in my school. So, I was very much an outsider. And plus I was Jewish and all of my friends were black and Baptist because they listen to the coolest music. We were all listening to Ray Charles and what was then called race music. And I guess the other white kids were listening to Dick Clark and American Bandstand, which was pretty sanitized compared to what I was listening to. And we were all very conscious of race. My parents both were doing the Civil Rights Movement, were very involved with the civil rights to Congress. And my friends' parents were as well. And I was on the bus one day and I saw a black and white couple, must have been 15, 16. He was black. She was white. And they were obviously in love. And people on the bus were glaring at them, but they didn't notice. They were just looking at each other and I started thinking, was this going to work? And the more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that it wouldn't work ultimately. That she would cop out, that her parents and the school would just not allow it. And that's the song I wrote, and I had no idea, when we recorded it, that it would ignite that kind of firestorm.",

He said if you change that word black to anything - anything else I can guarantee you a number one record. And he said, but it's your choice. And a friend of ours was standing there and he said, quote, unquote, \"you whore now, you'll whore forever,\" and that's a pretty strong words. I was 15 at that time. That was pretty strong.

And he said that I had to. And long story short, what he said in essence was if you let them drive you off the stage now they will do it to the next person and the next one and the next one. And then where will we be when the only people they agree with are allowed on stage? So I went back on stage, I was pretty sure that I was going to be killed. I was terrified. And I started to sing and they started to chant. And as I continued singing I just looked at them and members of the audience suddenly started taking in into their hands and going over and telling them to shut up and then - then all the ushers came down the aisle with their flashlights and shone them in these peoples faces and ordered them out. And what amazed me, Tony, was that they didn't walk out, they slunk out.
