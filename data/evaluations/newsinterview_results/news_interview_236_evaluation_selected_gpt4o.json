God's decision to restart creation by sparing two of every animal and sparing just one family from the deluge. The ark carries the family of Noah and his sons, plus a pair of every living creature. It also carries Noah's wife, who was not named in the Bible but goes on to become the matriarch of all future generations. Sarah Blake's new book gives that woman a name, a story and a purpose. It's called \"Naamah.\" And it retells the story of the great flood and what came before and after it. Sarah Blake joins me from our bureau in New York. Sarah, welcome.",

And there have been, certainly, books written that tried to give some of those women a name. Of all the stories and of all the unnamed women in the Bible you could have picked out, why did you go for Noah's wife?",
            "previous_answer": "What really struck me about Noah's wife was the way that she was so stuck. And I was writing the book at a time where I was feeling very stuck. The 2016 election had just happened, and I felt hopeless. And I didn't know how to look forward. I didn't know how to talk to my young son about looking forward at a bright future. And so I was rereading Genesis, and I came across the story of the ark. And it really hit me how long they were really on the ark, that it - you know, in my head and in the children's books, that the whole process is shortened. It's so quick. The rain seemed like what's a long time. But, really, it's over a year that they're on the ark just looking out over water. It's months and months and months until even the very tops of mountains appear. And that - I was just overwhelmed by the idea of looking across all the water and having no idea what was to come for Naamah and her family.",

And when I think about those things, to me, I'm thinking about bodies in their existence on - in the world and how many ways we have to take care of our bodies. And so - and pleasure has to do with that. And sex has to do with that. And I wanted to be really true to what that experience was going to be like. I wanted to have sex scenes that were really celebratory of a woman's pleasure. And so that was part of the drive of just being very - I mean, you could say erotic about it. But I - to me, it's just very direct. It very plainly speaks of how bodies interact and how they feel pleasure.",
