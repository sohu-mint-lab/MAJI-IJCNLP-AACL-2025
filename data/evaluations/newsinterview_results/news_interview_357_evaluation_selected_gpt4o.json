Black, we ask that you work for legislation that imposes a reasonable waiting period between firearm purchase and possession to provide a cooling-off period to guard against impulsive acts of violence. Andrew's mother, Alyssa Black, joins us now. Good morning.",

We really thought we were just speaking to Andrew's friends and family. This was not some broader plan on our part. The reason we put that in there is, personally, our family has been touched by suicide in the past. And one of the things that you learn is that there's so much shame around suicide that people don't say anything. And when people find out that your life has been touched as well by that, it breaks down walls for them as well. So one of the things that we were really clear about when we wrote that obituary was we wanted to make sure and not leave any question in anyone's mind how our son died. And you ask me how I want Andrew to be remembered. In 23 years, I never had a day where I was ashamed of Andrew being my son. And I wasn't going to be ashamed of the way he died. And I wanted people to know that. It was one day of his life, but his life encompassed so much more than that.",
