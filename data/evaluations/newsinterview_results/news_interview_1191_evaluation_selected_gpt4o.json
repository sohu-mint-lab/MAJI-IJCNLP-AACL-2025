And he says, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you could do with the attorney general would be great.

He was on Twitter, so he was very public about this in the past couple of months after the Mueller investigation wound up. He said he met an aide of the Ukrainian president. He said he was working with the State Department, that he cleared it with them, he was in contact with them.

He's not supposed to be taking orders from the president about who he should or shouldn't investigate. Now, Barr - consider him to be sort of in the middle of this. And he says he didn't hear about this phone call until weeks later. So on the one hand, the Justice Department, which he oversees, is investigating or looking into the whistleblower complaint. They also decided there shouldn't be a criminal charge opened up against the president. And on the other hand, the president is saying he's going to contact the Ukrainian president.
