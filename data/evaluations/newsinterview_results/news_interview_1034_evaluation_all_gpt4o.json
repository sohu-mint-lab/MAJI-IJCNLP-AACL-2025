            "actual_question": "This is SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. In the disease multiple sclerosis, the body's own immune cells stage a mutiny. Those cells, white cells, normally go after foreigners in the body like bacteria or other invaders that make us sick. But in MS, the immune cells go after the body itself, attacking the myelin covering that wraps around nerve cells. As that myelin gets degraded, nerve signals don't get transferred properly, and that's what leads to the symptoms of MS. For years, scientists have been trying to figure out how to stop the myelin attack, to get the body to stop going after itself. This week, researchers say they have some very early promising results for a new approach. Essentially, they have a way to teach the body not to go after itself, and a small preliminary study says the technique is at least safe to use in a larger test. Stephen Miller is professor of microbiology-immunology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. He's also a director of the Immunobiology Center at Northwestern in Chicago. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. DR. STEPHEN",

This study (unintelligible) many years of work at our laboratory trying to develop efficient ways to induce what immunologists call tolerance, which would be only inactivating the immune cells that are carrying out the autoimmune disease - in this case multiple sclerosis - without down-regulating responses to bacterial antigens, viral antigens, et cetera, that we really depend upon to keep us healthy. Most of the current therapies that are used in multiple sclerosis are in one way or another collectively called immunosuppressive therapies that act in one way or another to try to suppress the immune response to dampen the autoimmune disease, but in the consequence of use over a long term make people more susceptible to everyday infections and to higher rates of cancer. So our approach is to, you know, sort of use the magic bullet to specifically target the autoreactive cells in the immune system and leave everything else alone.",

You know, obviously, a concern when you're injecting a autoimmune individual with the same proteins that are under attack in the disease; the concern is that you might exacerbate the disease or make it worse. And we found out that what we were doing was safe, really no significant adverse events. And then by structuring this phase one trial such that we could carry out mechanistic assays on t-cells from the blood of these individuals, we were able to show, at least with the patients receiving the highest dose of the therapy - there were four of them in that category - that compared to a month prior to the treatment, three months after the treatment we were able to knock down, to some extent or another, the immune responses directed against myelin antigens but had no effect on an immune response that we all have, and that's to a protein called tetanus. We've all been immunized with tetanus vaccine. So that's really what immunologists define as tolerance, that specific ability to only knock down immune response against the antigens that we re-introduce back into the individuals.",

And then in a blood bag we took seven different myelin antigens that we knew were targets of the autoimmune attack in patients. And we - using a chemical reaction, we attached those antigens onto the patient's white blood cells and then re-introduced those cells intravenously back into the patient. Now, this attachment did one other critical thing. In addition to attaching the antigens, it also made the blood cells die by a particular process that's called apoptosis. And when these antigen-coupled cells, as we call them, purple blood cells, were re-introduced it back into the patient, they are then targeted to cells of the immune system that perceive cells dying by apoptosis as being nothing to be concerned about. And it essentially then tricks the immune system or the auto-reactive cells that are carrying out the autoimmune disease and to be turned down rather than turned on.",

And then they turn down the immune system for these types of cells and then don't attack the ones that are resident in the body.",

And that's the beauty of the technique because by just simply varying the antigens that are attached to the cells or the nanoparticles, we've shown, again, in mouse models of Type-1 diabetes and even in mouse models of allergy that we can attach the relevant antigen in Type-1 diabetes. We have used insulin, which is a protein that's lost in Type-1 diabetes because the autoimmune disease kills the beta cells that make that antigen.
