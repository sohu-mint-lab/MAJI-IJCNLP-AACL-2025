So on one hand, I always welcome anybody to that. We can't do it without federal help. But there's also solutions. Recently in Washington, D.C., the National Coalition to End Homelessness had a conference and said LA is now the model in terms of the work that we are doing.

But speaking of staying on the - kind of the causes side of it, the Council of Economic Advisers released a report this week.

            "previous_answer": "The report was very incomplete. I used to be a professor. I would have said it was an interesting start but certainly not a final product. And anybody who's worked in homelessness knows, of course, part of the problem can be constrained housing markets. In LA, we're at the second biggest peak in our history of building housing - 100,000 units in about six and a half years. So we're on a tear because we know that rents do affect whether people can hang on and stay in housing or whether they're out on the streets. But the idea in the paper that suddenly, if you deregulated, there would be 40% less homelessness - I think those of us who actually work on the streets and in American cities know it's much more complicated than that.",

Then Senators Feinstein and Representative Lieu put forward together the Fighting Homelessness Through Services and Housing Act, which is about $7.5 billion focusing on the health care needs of folks that are right now homeless. We also said uphold the Veterans Administration vision. There's a huge campus here in Los Angeles that the veterans administration owns. We've been able to build some housing for formerly homeless vets, and we need to do more. And they could step up right now with federal support for that.",
