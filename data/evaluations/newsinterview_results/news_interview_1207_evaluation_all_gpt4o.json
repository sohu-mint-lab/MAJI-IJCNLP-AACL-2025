They're 3 and 1 right now, but they will use Instagram when they get older. I think that certain things would absolutely be worse. Other things would be better. For me right now, the way my kids appear on Instagram is they have private accounts. They don't use them; they're literally 3 and 1 years old. But I manage them, and I share basically their upbringing with my family who lives all around the world. I have family in Pittsburgh. I have family in New York. I have family in Israel. I have family in Germany. I have family in LA. And they can stay up to date on what my boys are doing and how they're growing in a way that they wouldn't have been able to do just 15 years ago. And so there's good and there's bad that comes from connecting people. Technology is not inherently good, and it's not inherently bad.

Shortly after, The Atlantic published a story headlined \"Instagram Has A Massive Harassment Problem.\" People said it was too easy to set up anonymous pages just to taunt someone. They said the company wasn't responsive when they tried to sound the alarm about abuse, so now Mosseri is overseeing a rollout of new features that Instagram hopes will protect its users from bullying and keep them on the site. I asked him what he learned about bullying on the platform over the past year.",
            "previous_answer": "A few different things. One - a lot of it happens. Actually, most of it seems to happen between people who know each other in real life. Another is that the controls that we had before or have today are insufficient. So specifically, I and our researchers talked to a bunch of teens and we asked them, why don't you just block someone who is bullying you on the platform? Because you can block someone right now - they can't see you. You essentially don't exist on Instagram to them. And there were two reasons that came back. One was - often, that can actually escalate the situation. They'll figure that out. They'll know, and they will bully more, either on Instagram or elsewhere. And two is that you need, as a target of bullying, to see what the actor is actually doing. Teens would often say, like, they're talking about me. If I blocked them, I won't be able to see that. So I need to track what's actually happening. Which is why we've been developing this new control called restrict, which allows you to restrict an individual - it means that if they comment on your post, you'll see it, and it'll look to them as if they've - it's actually been commented on, but you have to approve it before anybody else sees it. It means that their messages are going to go into your other inbox, and you have to go there to see them and that they won't actually get read receipts - a whole bunch of different little nuanced ways to give a target of bullying a bit more power over the experience, which allows....",

I've also seen in the actual data that a minority but a significant minority of people do rewrite their comments, and they rewrite them in a much more pleasant way. Now, do most people rewrite their comments? No - because if you have an intent that's really intense to harass an individual, a polite comment from Instagram is not going to prevent you from doing so. But sometimes people get caught up in the moment, and a lightweight reminder can actually help them rethink what they're doing or what they're saying. And so it's not supposed to be the solution that we hang our hat on for all of bullying. It's supposed to be one of many tools to try to prevent bullying from happening in the first place.",
