            "previous_answer": "If you look at some of the characteristics I think that would define a successful process for impeachment and you compare that to what we saw with Director Mueller, he had more resources. He had more access to things like documents, emails. He had more access to the technical capabilities of the FBI, and he had more time. Remember; that was 2 1/2 years he spent coming to conclusions that didn't lead us too far down the path. The Democrats come at this from a partisan approach. He was nonpartisan with less time, fewer people, less technical capability. It's hard for me to see how in the next 15 months you can resolve this in a way that leaves us in the summer of 2020 looking back saying that was really good for America.",

If we move on from the central message that Mr. Muller was trying to impart, that we were and are indeed still being attacked by Russia, as someone who has worked in intelligence, isn't that a problem?",
            "previous_answer": "Yes, but we're talking about two different issues where one is an issue where we're going after people for lying during the investigative process. The other is an issue that was lost mostly during the hearings last week that we should focus on that you just discussed, which is how we think about Russia. If we spend a little less time on an impeachment process that won't succeed and maybe more time talking about how we help states defend themselves and how we talk to the American people about how they look at Facebook messages next year during the campaign, I think we'd be better off.",

In particular, it was known internally as the program which was the use of black sites in interrogations - still very controversial. Why did you want to write this book?",
            "previous_answer": "Well, first, I like words. My mom was a teacher, and she taught the family to love words. But in terms of the subject matter, you go back in time and you realize the immediacy of what we lived through. I still remember it almost every day. For years, I thought we were losing the battle against al-Qaida. And I thought if I didn't talk to my friends who will never speak and tell their story, try to have people - even if they don't like what we did, have people stand in our shoes, that the story, the immediacy, would be lost. So I wanted to use the words that my mom taught me and talk about a program in a time in American history that might be lost if I didn't write it.",

Whether you liked the program or not, the people who participated, created it - I'm not going to pass the buck. I was there. I lost my career over that program. They live next door to you. They're like you and me, and they were faced with choices at a time when we thought we would face a second wave that might lead to thousands of deaths at a time where we thought we didn't have many options.",

It's learned that - some people in this country, including members of Congress, don't like what we did. It's given people across this country a chance to reflect on what we did. But that reflection, I think, requires people also to step back to the spring of 2002 when we got our first prisoner and say, am I sure? Am I sure, before I critique the CIA, that I know what it was like? And I wanted to give them a chance to have that opportunity.",
