So when the president called those stories fake news at the time, you know, folks like you dismissed it, but it turned out he was right. Now, it does seem like he's dismissing it, and he's being dismissive of it. I'm not sure he completely understands the implications of the impeachment inquiry. I think Nancy Pelosi is the smartest person in Washington right now. And I think she didn't pull the trigger on this without knowing that she had more ammunition in her guns. And so I think this is just the beginning. And I'm not sure this White House is prepared for it. It doesn't have the communications staff or the response that's going to be necessary for an impeachment ordeal. There's six committees opening guns up on the president. And there's been, you know, staff that still needs to be appointed in the White House. It's just not a good situation. And I believe that the focus for the country should be on doing legislation that improves the quality of life and improves our security.",
