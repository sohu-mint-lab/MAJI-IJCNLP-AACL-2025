Now President Kabila says it was because of a rebellion in the east and troubles in other parts of Congo. That was the priority. So that is why he hasn't left office yet. But many Congolese are saying, no. You've been a caretaker president for two long years. It's time for change. It's time for us to move on. At last, they're voting. This morning in Kinshasa, there were torrential rainstorms. And there was a very, very timid participation. But now the sun's out. And we are seeing long, long, long lines at polling stations as the Kinois, as they're called - people of Kinshasa, men and women - wait to vote enthusiastically and patiently.",
