I have researched anti-corruption, you know, uprisings around the world, you know, in places from Guatemala to Burkina Faso to South Korea. There's intense activity to basically provoke regime change - right? - to overthrow or get investigated or impeach the chief of state. And when that happens, the activists all go home, normally. The problem is that the practices often continue. The networks reconfigure themselves. And the country finds itself in just as bad a state afterwards as before.

I mean, you said that it really troubled you when you would hear people in the news media say that there was no wrongdoing when it came to the Bidens. And, I mean, in truth, some of what President Trump has said sort of pushing this storyline about Joe Biden pressuring the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor who was investigating Hunter Biden - that part of the story has been widely debunked, which may be why you hear journalists saying, you know, no wrongdoing. So I guess I'm wondering is there a risk in that bringing this up will cause people to take parts of the story of the Bidens more seriously, even if they're just not true?",
            "previous_answer": "Not if they make the right distinctions. You are exactly right. Vice President Biden did not pressure the government of Ukraine to remove a prosecutor because he was doing too much anti-corruption investigation, including into his son's company. Rather, he pressured the government of Ukraine as a part of concerted U.S. policy, in line with the views of all of the civil society groups that were engaged and our Western partners, right? That's a completely different situation from President Trump's phone call. Vice President Biden did not commit the act of corruption that President Trump is accusing him of - on the contrary. That doesn't mean that there's no wrongdoing here. And I think it is critical in these polarized days that as we American citizens consider corruption in our system, we not only point the finger at the opposing party or the opposing identity group. That's too easy. We have to, each of us, first hold our own groups to account first - all of us.",

I mean, what I hear you saying that your desire - and, again, this is an issue of politics, corruption you've written about, you've reported on in Afghanistan, the United States. I mean, you're saying, here is an issue and a name in the news. You want to use it to draw attention to a huge problem that you think is so important to our democracy, shine light on it and push to do something about it. But given our media and political environment today, is it overly optimistic and overly, dare I say, idealist to think that that's what's going to happen - that people will get the nuance and understand what specific reforms are necessary and the politics will just stay out of it?",
            "previous_answer": "I think we have to raise the standards. And to say, oh, OK, I am going to completely whitewash my own side - you know, because the standard of debate is so low in the United States that I'm going to contribute to keeping it that low by not calling on us to think and act as citizens - I'm not willing to give up on the United States to that extent.",
