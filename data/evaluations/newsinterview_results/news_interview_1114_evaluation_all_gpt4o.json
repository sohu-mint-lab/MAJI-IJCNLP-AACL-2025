She tells of that city, Istanbul, Turkey, through one of its residents - one of its late residents. As the story begins, a woman has been killed. She had been working as a prostitute and was stuffed in a dumpster. She is dead - although, the author adds, not quite.",

And in some cases, this could go up to 10 minutes. To me, the whole thing was fascinating. And maybe the question that I wanted to ask was, what exactly happens inside our minds in that limited amount of time?",

So it's a very difficult environment for authors as well.

You're going to make it easier - particularly in the countryside, in rural areas - for families to marry off their children at a young age, and you will also increase cases of polygamy. So we have huge problems in Turkey when it comes to child brides. We have problems when it comes to gender-based violence. So that's the mentality that we have to fight against in Turkey.",

You know, if our blood family - the family we grow up in - is loving and kind and tender, we should count our blessings. That is wonderful. Not everyone is as lucky though. And particularly to those people, the book is saying, do not forget. As you keep living, you're going to have another family - your water family, your friends. And in that regard, I think, particularly in countries where democracy is lost and where the public space has become very intolerant, water families are even more important.

What is interesting, at least to me, is there's an actual place in Istanbul; it's a graveyard. It's called the Cemetery of the Companionless. Unlike any other cemetery, there are no names. There are no tombstones, no surnames - yeah? - nothing personal on the graves, just numbers. It is a place where actual people are turned into numbers. And nobody goes there. Nobody pays attention. It's completely neglected. I became very drawn to this place. You know, I've been doing research. Who are the people who are buried here? And when you do that, you realize there are many outcasts there, for instance, many LGBTQ members who have been shunned by their families. The families did not want to give them a proper funeral. There are also lots of sex workers there. There are also people who have died of AIDS - suicides. And then there is also a growing number of refugees. Every day in newspapers, we read about how refugees have drowned while they were trying to cross into Europe. But where are all these bodies taken? They are taken to the Cemetery of the Companionless. So it's a very sad and strange place. And I wanted to, as an author, at least take one of those numbers because in the book my main character is buried there.",
