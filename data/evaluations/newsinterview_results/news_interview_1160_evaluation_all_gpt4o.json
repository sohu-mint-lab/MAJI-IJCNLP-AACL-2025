I guess you could say dragging out what could have, should have been a simple deal to return to The Dodgers months ago. Instead, he and agent Scott Boras and Dodger owner Frank McCourt and GM Ned Colletti strung their poor fans along all of this time. And just like that, Manny arrives in on a white horse and some stringy braids to save the day.",

And you know, McCourt said very earnestly, listen, you know, we really want Manny not just to be part of the team but we really want him to be part of the community. And Boras said, stop. I think you need to tell that to Manny. So, Manny got on a plane, he came in, flew in and they had a great face to face. And you know, Manny sort to say listen, yeah I know that I've got to do a little more. I've got to do a little better. And I think it was a great healing kind of - not a healing but, you know, conversation. And, you know, Manny is very comfortable on L.A. He's in a place where he's got a great fan base, they love him. And so I think - I think it's going to be a very powerful thing. I - injuries notwithstanding, Tony, I mean, I think that you guys there are going to be in for a really, really special season. I think The Dodgers are going to be tougher, they're going to be better, and Manny's going to really be engaged.",

It's for momentum. Who goes in with a lot of momentum? And that's what the regular season is about - going downhill and gathering momentum and hitting March Madness with a full steam ahead. I like Connecticut a lot, not - you know, particularly sinceJim O'Brien is motivated to prove that he's worth the money he's getting paid. And I like North Carolina a lot, and I always reserve two spots for teams that we aren't even discussing now. That it's going to be probably the sweet 16.",
