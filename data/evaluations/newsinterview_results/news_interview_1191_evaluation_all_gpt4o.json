And he says he didn't hear about this phone call until weeks later. So on the one hand, the Justice Department, which he oversees, is investigating or looking into the whistleblower complaint. They also decided there shouldn't be a criminal charge opened up against the president. And on the other hand, the president is saying he's going to contact the Ukrainian president. And here's Barr, sitting in the middle of this, saying, I didn't hear about that call, what am I - more or less pleading ignorance.",
