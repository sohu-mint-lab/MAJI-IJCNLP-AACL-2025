Although, I should say that before Robert Mueller testified, it was at about 95. So we haven't exactly seen a big groundswell of impeachment following his testimony. I think the Congress reflects, right now, where the country is - there's a bunch of people really for it, a bunch of people really against it and not much moving in one direction or the other.

Remember; the Tea Party movement in 2010 really started to rise up during the August recess when members were home. I don't think we're going to see something like that along the lines of impeachment, but I do think you would have to see a groundswell of a public opinion change or Democrats going home and realizing that this is not what their constituents want. We don't know the answer to that question yet. One thing I think we do know the answer to is that we're not going to really see any Republicans budge on the question of impeachment. And so that threshold that the House speaker has set for her to want to move forward - that it would be overwhelming and bipartisan - seems almost certainly to be an impossible standard.",

It does kind of feed the reality TV-ification (ph) of our politics in the sense that it's more about entertainment. One thing I do think we're all watching for, though, is to see where - what the Democratic Party ultimately is going to stand for in the 2020 election. You still have this immense sort of intellectual debate going on in the party of whether it's going to move more to the left and be a more progressive party or hold on and try to reclaim or be the party of the center. And we simply don't know the answer to that question yet. And whether the nominee is someone like a Joe Biden or someone like a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren is going to be two dramatically different Democratic parties and two dramatically different general elections. So I think the big topics that we've been hearing a lot in these debates is health care. One thing I think we're going to hear a lot more about in this debate is immigration just because that is an issue that has increasingly been captivating the public because of what's been happening at the U.S.-Mexico border and because of President Trump's immigration policies.",

I've asked Democrats that, and they will also - you know, they're a little skeptical of that because if you look back to the 2016 Republican primaries, Republican candidates were also talking about very, very conservative policies on social and fiscal matters, and it didn't really matter when it came to the general election.
