You know, earning one's life by selling paintings didn't exist. It was not something you could do. You could paint on Sundays, be a Sunday painter, and then have a real job. And also, as he grew up, he absolutely never saw a homosexual. He was the son of Methodist parents who didn't even know what homosexuality was, except it was a crime punished by God. In addition, at the time in England, in the '50s, it was a crime punished by law. And this man grew up to become this incredible artist, you know, earning his life with his paintings from a very young age, and a militant homosexual. So he really invented himself.",

            "previous_answer": "David Hockney is obviously not myself. But it's the same process of writing. I'm trying to understand from the inside. I am not interested in the factual truth. My book is very factual. I read everything. It's as accurate as it can be. I cannot invent. He's alive. The man is alive. He's 81. I cannot invent his life. But what interested me is really the emotional truth. How could he be a figurative artist at a time when everybody was abstract? Try to imagine this young David Hockney arriving from his provincial town in London at the age of 22 and discovering that figurative painting, which is what he's doing, is not done. He has a friend at the school who says, oh, you cannot paint like Monet after Pollock. And David Hockney hears this and thinks, oh, my God, if I continue painting the way I was painting, I'm done for. I will never be well-known. So it is complicated. And I tried to place myself in his mind. He tried to become an abstract painter. But he was very depressed. And his friend, at some point, told him, you know, stop thinking about being a contemporary artist. It doesn't matter. You are contemporary. You live in your time. Just paint what matters to you.",

And he was extremely affected, extremely depressed. He was really on the verge of suicide at the time. And suddenly he didn't feel like painting anymore, and he stopped. So he was never prisoner of a formula. Also, I am really interested in his reaction - in his relationship to criticism.",
