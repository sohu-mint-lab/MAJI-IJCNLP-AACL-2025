On Friday, Attorney General William Barr received the special counsel's findings on Russian interference in the 2016 election. Barr is now reviewing that report. And he has said he'll soon advise Congress on Mueller's principal conclusions. Well, that's not likely to quiet congressional calls on both sides of the aisle for the full report to be made public. Joining me now to talk about all this is NPR's congressional reporter Kelsey Snell. Welcome.",

They're basically saying that they want the information to be released to the greatest extent possible. And they haven't really defined what that means.

They are really important because they say that the public really needs to understand how Mueller reached his conclusions and who Mueller talked to and who Mueller didn't talk to. They want to know if anybody turned down a request to comment or, you know, the extent to which there was discussion of particularly wrongdoing within Trump's inner circle. And, you know, this isn't just something that she said in a letter. It's something that came up in an emergency call that Pelosi and one of her top deputies, Hakeem Jeffries, called with the committee chairs. And on that call, they took letter - they took questions from Democrats who wanted to make sure that as much information as possible was preserved - to the extent that those chairs got off the call and sent joint letters with Democrats in the Senate, demanding that the work product be maintained by the Justice Department. And that's a pretty big step. Though, I have to say, that doesn't mean that the Justice Department will go along with that request. It's just something that Democrats say needs to be done.",

Though, one thing that I think is really interesting here is there was a recent, totally non-binding vote in the House where they voted 420-0, not a single person voting against it - the idea that they needed to demand the Justice Department release the report. Now, we've also heard some senators, like Chuck Grassley, who is a former Judiciary Committee chairman, saying the report needs to be public to end the speculation and, he says, innuendo that has loomed over the administration.",
