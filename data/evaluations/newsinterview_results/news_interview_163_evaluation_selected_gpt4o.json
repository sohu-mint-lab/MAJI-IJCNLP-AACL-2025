We first spoke to Andrew's mother, Alyssa Black, shortly after her son's death. She was calling for Vermont to pass legislation requiring a cooling-off period between when a person can walk into a gun store and walk out with a firearm. A bill requiring a 24-hour waiting period moved to the top of the Vermont Senate's agenda earlier this year. It passed in both houses. And then last week, it was vetoed by Governor Phil Scott. Alyssa Black joins me now. Welcome to WEEKEND EDITION.",

His only thoughts were, we did enough last year. Well, clearly we didn't do enough last year. And just because you do something one year doesn't mean that you can't do something the year after.

They'd had a very bitter year the year before, and nobody wanted to touch it again. The fact that we got it through the Senate and the House with broad support and got to the governor's desk, frankly, is a bit of a miracle. And we'll try again next year.
