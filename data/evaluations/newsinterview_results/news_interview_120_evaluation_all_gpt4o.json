            "previous_answer": "You know, it's certainly part of President Trump's reelection strategy. It might become the driving strategy, depending on what the Democratic ticket looks like next year. I don't think, in some ways, this comes as a surprise if you follow politics because Donald Trump has a long history of using racial divides in America to advance his brand and his political goals. I think this is happening because Trump's clearest path - and I would say maybe his only path to reelection - will require winning again in those so-called blue states - Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. And those states are home to high numbers of Trump's strongest supporter. Who is that? The white working-class voter. So if those voters show up in force in 2020, that's his best shot at a second term. And I think this week just proves he's willing to say pretty much whatever he thinks to get him there.",

It's much harder to see a 2020 in which he can improve his numbers with women, young people and Latinos then try to double down on the white support that he has very strongly and especially because white voters still cast most of the votes in this country. You are absolutely right, though, that this is a risky strategy. If you remember those three blue states, it was about 80,000 votes that swung those three states. That's really not a steep hill for Democrats to climb to win them back, especially if they can motivate voters on the other side. I also say the Republicans, a lot of time, act like 2018 didn't happen, where there was this huge blue wave. It was the most racially diverse electorate ever. It was sort of a glimpse into the future of what's to come. But I also think that the downside for Democrats - in that a lot of the demographic changes that are changing this country - are not happening in the places that matter much to presidential elections. For instance, in places like California, if Democrats win a million more votes in 2020, that doesn't change the electoral math. And that's what we're talking about here.",

We get these approval rating check-ins almost daily. And that's despite the economy before this week's drama. But I wonder if it's an instructive measure anymore.",
            "previous_answer": "I think it's significant because it speaks to one of the most fascinating aspects about the Trump presidency in that, despite all of the conflict and division, he has the most stable approval ratings of any president since we began polling presidents, you know? Presidents have seen 30, 40, 50-point swings in approval over the course of their presidencies. Trump's has stayed in about this 9-point range. That 45% is the high end of that. So, right now, he's actually enjoying some of his highest approval ratings. I think what that tells me is that this is a country that really has its mind made up about Donald Trump and that the 2020 election isn't going to be about persuading voters to change their mind. It's really about just getting them to show up.",
