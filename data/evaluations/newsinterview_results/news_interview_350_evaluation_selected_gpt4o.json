What is unique about it is that it's a journalist, so more people actually heard about it.

So it usually takes place not in a closed place but, perhaps, in front of a governmental building or on the street. However, what you do notice is that - and this is an unfortunate result of the increase of such acts - is that politicians tend to rely on different other possible reasons for such acts. For example, they would say that there are, perhaps, mental illnesses that are spreading or that maybe this was planned. And this, in a way, removes or takes the discussion away from the hardship that those people are going through.",
