So these are people who are actually trying to evaluate things for the most part - not simply from a my-side or your-side point of view. And what we found in these focus groups was that most people, Democrats and Republicans in this - in the sort of middle of the spectrum, they did think there was something there with the investigation. They thought it was a good thing for it to be investigated. Maybe some of the Republicans felt it was going on too long. But you see this in polls as well. People generally supported the investigation, thought it was merited. And they were confused by it, frankly. They weren't - they weren't following all of the twists and turns of it.",

It was a result that was fairly equivocal, a result that, in the actual words - in the literal words of the special counsel himself, did not either exonerate or not exonerate the president. So people do have to sort of figure out where they are on that without the report giving them, you know, a big neon sign of, it's all on one side or it's all on the other. But the other thing that I think that shows is that over the past two years, where the president has kept up this increasing drumbeat about this probe being a witch hunt, about it being a hoax, literally trying to convince people that it was invented out of thin air by - by vengeful partisans out to get him, the public broadly doesn't believe that narrative. And now that the president is, again, untrue - untruthfully saying that he's been exonerated, the public doesn't believe that either, by and large. They - they, I think, are seeing this report for what it is, which is not an exoneration and not a witch hunt.",
