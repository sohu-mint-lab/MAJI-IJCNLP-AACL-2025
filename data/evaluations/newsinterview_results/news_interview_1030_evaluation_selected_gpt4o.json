Powerful storms this spring: tornadoes like the ones in Oklahoma have caused damage estimated in the billions of dollars and dozens of deaths. But does the destruction have to be so devastating? What are the engineering challenges to designing and building stronger, more tornado-resistant structures and providing better protection for the people who live there? David O. Prevatt is an assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida in Gainesville, and part of a team of engineers that surveyed tornado damage in Moore, Okla., and other places.

Thanks to efforts of our FEMA guides and so on, we were able to get into these buildings. A couple things that I noted with the shelters, these - you know, near absolute protection is something that is desired, but in terms of budget it may not always be there. I think we can do a lot more in terms of the schools, providing roll-up doors or somewhere bracing those corridors in schools so that they're not facing directly to the exterior, and we can protect people's lives there. One of the things I would mention, Ira, is in the Moore medical complex, they sheltered 300 people in that shelter during the 20th May tornado with no injuries. This was interesting to us for two reasons: One, they only had 30 patients and staff at the time so that the majority of these people came from around the area, from homes, from the malls, et cetera, et cetera, because they wanted to seek shelter for themselves. And this is what will happen with any shelter that one provides in a town or city.",

But the - within these - there were several walls protecting this shelter, it probably was hardened, and the corridors themselves were - they were sort of radially - they had several angles and bends and so on. So even though the wind blew out the exterior doors, by the time it got to the entrance of the shelter, it sort of bypassed it and didn't blow into the shelter itself.",

And, you know, we're on to the 10th anniversary of when that bill was initiated. I think it's leadership. I think we have to decide once and for all - the one question we need to ask is do we want to live in wind-hazard-resilient communities? And if so, what does it take to get there? As I said, I made the comparison today between the 40 years since the Lubbock tornado, when the weather systems have become so far advanced, and money has been spent, about $170 million over the last 10 years, in better equipment and so on. All of us, all of us benefit from this, OK. By the same token, if 40 years ago we spent that type of research and gauged, you know, the enthusiasm and eagerness of, you know, bright, bright graduate students who I have working with me right now, we would have solved this problem. And I think we can still do that now in a 10-year frame, but it requires that sort of, you know, let's go the moon type of attitude.",
