We had to move the entire high school to a different location. And we were able to pull that off. But as it's went on and we're into the seventh month of this, it's been very, very difficult for kids because they're living far away. And they're not vested in where they're living. So they're not making friends there. Most teenagers struggle with the teenage years. And when you add a trauma event like this, where you lose your entire community, your house, your church, your work and you lose all that support system, it's been very difficult mentally. And it's been very difficult for us to find enough counselors to be able to help students get to where they need to be.",
