A suspect is in custody. He's a 21-year-old male from a suburb outside Dallas. Police held up - held off from identifying him yesterday but said he surrendered to them at an intersection just behind the Walmart. The El Paso police chief said authorities are looking into this attack as a potential hate crime. There's a manifesto circulating online, possibly linked to this suspect, that reflects an anti-immigrant sentiment and mentions a, quote, \"Hispanic invasion of Texas.\"",

And they've entered the U.S. One of the cities is - in the U.S. is here in El Paso. Now, El Paso didn't get its name out of thin air. This has been a central pathway for migration for centuries before the U.S. and Mexico even existed. And that history is reflected in the people who live here today. The shopping district where this mass killing happened is the perfect reflection of the binational, bicultural character of the city. There were probably parents shopping for back-to-school supplies from both sides of the border. On any given day, you'll hear both English and Spanish spoken in the aisles of any of the city's stores. It's normal here, and it's been that way for as long as the city has existed.",

But statistics show El Paso has had a low crime rate compared to other cities its size well before the presence of a border wall. The number of people killed and injured in yesterday's mass shooting is higher than the average number of people murdered here in an entire year. And I should point out that a border wall would in no way have stopped the shooter from committing yesterday's massacre. Also, because of its location on the U.S.-Mexico border, the city is home to a plethora of law enforcement - federal, state and local - who keep a close watch on the city. And, finally, cities - studies show that cities like El Paso with a large immigrant population tend to have lower crime rates.",

I saw El Pasoans show up to that school with truckloads of water. There is an interfaith vigil organized tonight at a local park.
