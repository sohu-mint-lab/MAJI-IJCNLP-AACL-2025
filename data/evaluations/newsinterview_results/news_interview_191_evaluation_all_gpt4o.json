But they're great crime mysteries that are - also have really great characterization but not at the expense of plot. And so the book I want to recommend is called \"Pieces Of Her.\" It's totally propulsive. It's about a young woman named Andy Oliver. She's at lunch with her mom, chatting it up when, all of a sudden, next to her a deranged young man comes up with a gun. And her mother does something very, very surprising for a lady who is described as knowing where all the tops to the Tupperware are, which is that she very calmly and coolly kills him.",

And it's called \"Murder By The Book.\" It's by Claire Harman. And it's about a murder in Victorian London in which a minor aristocrat is murdered by his valet. Now, it actually does sound like fiction, right? It's nonfiction. But what's so wonderful about it is this guy's defense was that he had read a popular novel, and the book made me do it, which is kind of a wonderful thing if you think about what fiction can do. However, it's also this wonderful book about class and how we think about the way that books influence us. Every detail is amazing. I just - I - Claire Harman describes the aristocrat as being ripe and aged. It also really answers this essential question of how powerful can books be.",
