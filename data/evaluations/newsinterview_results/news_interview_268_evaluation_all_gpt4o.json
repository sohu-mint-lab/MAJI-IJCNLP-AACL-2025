And Syrians, depending on where they've landed, have been extended, you know, less-than-welcome welcomes. I think those who are returning home or choosing to go back have - are willing to live under the regime again and live under the sort of circumvention of their rights and their liberties just to be home. You know, and it depends. Not all of the country was destroyed to the same levels as other parts. I have a friend who is in Aleppo right now, and she managed to go back to her grandmother's apartment. And in many ways, some things, obviously, inside the apartment are absolutely unchanged.

Other Syrians have identified them. And there might be hopes that there can be an accountability in that sense.

But what is very different this time than in 2011 is for the 50 years that the Assad regime has been in power, has always acted as a chaperone between Syrians and has not allowed Syrians to talk to each other directly or to know each other directly. You know, the Syrian state telling you that your Sunni neighbors are all fundamentalists and are eventually going to come, you know, kill all the rest of you minorities, or that the minorities hate religiosity - I mean, now there's this opportunity for people to sort of talk to each other directly. Unfortunately, that's happening mostly outside of Syria. But I think, you know, in a few years, it'll be very hard for the state to control Syrians in the same way that it once did and which it used to its benefit to stay in power.",
