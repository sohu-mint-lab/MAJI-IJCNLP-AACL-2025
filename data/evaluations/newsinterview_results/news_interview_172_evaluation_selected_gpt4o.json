Onboard was an Uruguayan rugby team, along with friends and relatives. Twenty-nine people initially survived that crash, and their story of struggle in the mountains became the subject of books and movies, most famously \"Alive.\" Among those survivors was a young architect named Eduardo Strauch, who held off writing about the tragedy until now. \"Out Of The Silence: After The Crash\" is a story of endurance and the spiritual awakening that came after 72 days trapped in the Andes. Eduardo Strauch joins me now from Montevideo in Uruguay. Welcome to the program.",

So maybe a week, we try to eat the leather shoes and the leather belts. But it was impossible to get the proteins from there, so we start a mental process to convince our minds that was the only way. We're not going to do nothing wrong. And at last, I was convinced that it was the only way to live. I want to live. I was very young. And at the beginning, when I realized it was what I was going to do, my mind and my conscience was OK. But physically, it was very difficult to get it in the first day. Even to us, they were very small pieces of frozen meat. It doesn't taste anything. I get used to. And at the end - absolutely disconnected with the origin of that food.",

We have many cases of people who - they decided to commit suicide. And when they crossed with our story, it changed their thoughts. And they continue living. People who are lost in alcohol and drugs - the same. We helped many, many cases, and it's really amazing that so much suffering, 47 years later, became something so positive for me and for so many people.",
