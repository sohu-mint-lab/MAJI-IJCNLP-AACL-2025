And there's been dissent within his own administration over his recently announced decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. This week, Brett McGurk, the top diplomat in charge of the global fight against ISIS, announced he has quit - this after Trump's well-respected Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis submitted a very public resignation. The president announced today that Mattis is out ahead of schedule, as of New Year's Day. Retired Gen. Jack Keane is chairman of the Institute for the Study of War. He personally recommended Gen. Mattis to President Trump. And he has been speaking to the president. He is with us now. General, welcome to the program.",

And I do think, in time, the president may find himself to regret this decision. I do hope he does reconsider it. My concerns are these. There are still the remnants of ISIS in southeastern Syria. And we have to finish that. And many people are confused by what role the soldiers or our troops are performing there. We have about 2,200. They are not the primary fighters. The primary fighters are Syrians, Kurds and Arabs. Our leaders there are assisting them in the planning of operations. And they're coordinating the use of artillery fire and air power, which, at times, can be very decisive when you have pitched foot infantry battles, which these are largely. And so to pull those forces out of there will deny them the opportunity of that artillery and airpower, which would put them at a disadvantage. And many people think that our forces are doing the primary fighting. They are not. They're assisting. But they are in a dangerous place to be sure. I don't want to deceive anybody of that. They're in a combat zone. They're right where the fighting is taking place. So clearly, there's danger and risk to them.",

That's where the battle took place in Raqqa. And there's no electricity.

It takes - it'll take hundreds of millions of dollars to put that area back together. We committed ourselves to those people to do that.
