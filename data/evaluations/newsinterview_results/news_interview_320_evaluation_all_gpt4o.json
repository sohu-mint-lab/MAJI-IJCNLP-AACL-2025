In Utah, a 27-year-old man was arrested on a terrorism charge after posting on social media about being a virgin and saying he wanted to become, quote, \"the next mass shooter.\" What both in New York and Utah incidents have in common is the profile of those involved - young, white men. According to a recent report by the Anti-Defamation League, 98 percent of the extremist-related murders in the United States in 2018 were carried out by right-wing extremists, a large portion white supremacists. We wanted to explore further this issue of men, particularly young men in the U.S., who turn to violent extremism. And we're joined now by a man who understands this firsthand - Tony McAleer. He's a former organizer for the White Aryan Resistance. He left that life behind and helped then start Life After Hate. It's a group of former violent extremists committed to education and countering violent ideologies. Welcome to the program.",

But I'm trying to share with you the lens through which I made those decisions. I grew up in a middle-class family. My father was a psychiatrist. But, you know, I walked in on my father when I was 10 with another woman. And that turned my world upside down. I rejected all the authority figures in my life. I went into sort of rebellion mode. And I went from this A, B student to a C, D student. My parents and the teachers got together and said, well, let's beat the grades into him. And so they tried to - you know, I got hit on the rear end with a yardstick every time I didn't get an A or B on major tests and assignments. And all those times that I spent in that teacher's office getting hit on the rear end, to this day, I don't think I've ever felt more powerless in my entire life. So I got involved in the punk scene because I was really angry. And then, you know, when I came across the skinheads, they had what I didn't. And that was toughness. And that's what drew me to them initially was - my bullying survival skill growing up was befriend the bully, become the bully. And that's what I did because when I was with them, I was safe.",

You know, at the age of 20, I thought I'd be dead or in jail as a white revolutionary by the time I was 30. I was a father at 23. For the first time in my life, I started to make decisions for someone other than myself because I was a complete narcissist. And the crazy thing about children is their love is unconditional. They didn't care that I was a neo-Nazi. They didn't care that I had assault rifles in the closet. They don't see that. They just see the human that's interacting with them. And that's sort of what compassion does. And it allowed me to thaw. And when we're compassionate with someone, we hold up a mirror and allow them to see their humanity reflected back at them when they're incapable of seeing it on their own. And I think that's the power of compassion. It's at the power - it's - compassion is at the root of, you know, what we do at Life After Hate.",
