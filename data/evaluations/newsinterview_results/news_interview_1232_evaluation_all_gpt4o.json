It sounds like something from the movies, but it's true: Researchers unearth an organism frozen inside a glacier, take it back to the lab and discover it's still alive. In this case it's a plant called a bryophyte, a moss that survives being frozen in a glacier in the dark for some 400 years. Wow. That work is being described this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Catherine La Farge is the director and curator of the Cryptogamic Herbarium in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alberta. She's also one of the authors of the paper.

            "previous_answer": "Well, it wasn't that we stumbled upon it. We had known that there was a lot of vegetation coming out from underneath the Tear Drop Glacier up in Sverdrup Pass on north - in central Ellesmere Island. And we were up there for a various number of different projects. And we thought that we would take a closer look at the margin of the glacier to see this vegetation. And what amazed us was that we did see large populations of bryophytes coming out from underneath the glacier that looked like they had a greenish tinge. And we thought, well, that was pretty weird that they still retained some greenish color. So we thought that we would gather up some of that material and bring it back down south to check out the age of it. And that we did, and we looked at it a little more closely by, you know, teasing it apart underneath a microscope in the lab and noticed that it looked like yes, indeed, some of the tips looked green, some of the - or some of the material looked like they were developing or had developed branches. So we decided to go back another year, back in 2009, to do a more systematic study of collecting a large number of samples. And so that's what we did.",

And that means that all of the cells of a particular plant can actually be reprogrammed to initiate the development of a whole new individual. And it's not that every single species can do that, but there are a large number that can.",

            "previous_answer": "Well, I think it really pushes back when we think about repopulating deglaciated landscapes, where is the genetic material coming from as far as, you know, the Arctic flora and probably in the Alpine areas, as well, you know, that we're not only dealing with populations that are above and beyond the margins of these glaciers, but we are also dealing with genetic material that goes back much further. And I think if you're thinking about, you know, trying to have a - any kind of plant material that say would be sent to extraterrestrial areas, like if you wanted to try something on the moon or on Mars or something like that, definitely bryophytes would have a great potential because they are programmed to be able to dry out, desiccate totally. They are programmed in the Arctic species anyway to be able to be frozen for long periods of time. I think the biology of bryophytes really needs to be emphasized in research, and hopefully this will give them - put them into the limelight a little bit.",
