So men doing 35% of the domestic work felt, of all the people in the study, that things were most fair.

We totally planned to do everything split equally, even though it was more of a vague notion than a planned assumption. And it really doesn't work that way. We didn't take into account our own internalized sexism - not just his sexism, my internalized sexism, my impulse to go out of my way to spare him any inconvenience. So I think if couples really sit down and say, you know, this is how it's going to go if we're not careful, they can be careful. And the couples I talked to who were doing this most successfully really made parity a team effort and a goal. So then they could sit down when either of them felt overburdened and say, hey, this mutual goal we set, I'm feeling like we're not meeting it. We have to recalibrate. One woman said to me - she was actually a sociologist who had gone to school to study work and family. And she knew it was going to go this way. And she said to her boyfriend, who later became her husband, look; if you want to be with me, we're going to make a spreadsheet. And we're going to decide who does what. And he said, well, let's let it be more organic. And I don't know if they ever made the spreadsheet. But the two of them really decided early on that they were committed to this. He also happened to be Swedish, which she said helped. But, you know, really kind of staying on top of it seemed to be the most important thing for couples.",
