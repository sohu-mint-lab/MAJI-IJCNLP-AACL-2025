She went on to become on of the 1970's best loved artist with classics like the tune \"At Seventeen.\" But the impact of \"Society's Child\" has stayed with her to this day. It's the title of her recently released autobiography. I asked Janis Ian to share the story behind the \"Society's Child\" and how she came to write a song with so much insight at age 13.",
            "previous_answer": "I was one of I think three white girls in my school. So, I was very much an outsider. And plus I was Jewish and all of my friends were black and Baptist because they listen to the coolest music. We were all listening to Ray Charles and what was then called race music. And I guess the other white kids were listening to Dick Clark and American Bandstand, which was pretty sanitized compared to what I was listening to. And we were all very conscious of race. My parents both were doing the Civil Rights Movement, were very involved with the civil rights to Congress. And my friends' parents were as well. And I was on the bus one day and I saw a black and white couple, must have been 15, 16. He was black. She was white. And they were obviously in love. And people on the bus were glaring at them, but they didn't notice. They were just looking at each other and I started thinking, was this going to work? And the more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that it wouldn't work ultimately. That she would cop out, that her parents and the school would just not allow it. And that's the song I wrote, and I had no idea, when we recorded it, that it would ignite that kind of firestorm.",

Well, of course, I mean, if you go on stage everyday thinking that you're not going to survive the hour, you're going to be frightened of your audience. So, in that sense, it was a scar but as my therapist said to me, you know, scar tissue is stronger that regular tissue.",

And the words were just ringing in my ears. And the promoter came back and told me I had to go back out, and I said, look, now, I get death threats, you don't understand. I can't go back out there. And he said that I had to. And long story short, what he said in essence was if you let them drive you off the stage now they will do it to the next person and the next one and the next one. And then where will we be when the only people they agree with are allowed on stage? So I went back on stage, I was pretty sure that I was going to be killed. I was terrified. And I started to sing and they started to chant. And as I continued singing I just looked at them and members of the audience suddenly started taking in into their hands and going over and telling them to shut up and then - then all the ushers came down the aisle with their flashlights and shone them in these peoples faces and ordered them out. And what amazed me, Tony, was that they didn't walk out, they slunk out. And I realized that the power of just a little three and a half minute song, that it had quite literally conquer their hatred and shown them for the cowards and bullies that they were.",

There's no way that Nashville would have had room for somebody like me then. I see interracial couples all the time in Nashville. I'm a Jew in Nashville. I'm a gay person in Nashville. It's a non-issue in most of the time. That's a huge leap forward. (Singing) You come to my door, baby, Your face is clean and shinning, black as night. My momma went to answer, You know, that you looked so kind. Now, I could understand the tears and the shame, She called you, boy, instead of your name, When she wouldn't let you inside, When she turned and said, \"But, honey, he's not our kind.\" She says I can't see you anymore, baby, I can't see you anymore. You walk me down to school, baby, And everybody's acting deaf and blind. Until they turn and say, Why don't you just stick to your own kind. My teachers all laugh, their smirking stares, And cutting deep down in our affairs. Preachers of equality, Think they believe it, Then why won't they just let us be…",
