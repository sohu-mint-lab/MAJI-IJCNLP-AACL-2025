Among them was American Cody Weddle, who was working in Caracas as a freelance reporter. Last week, Weddle was woken up. Four armed Venezuelan officers were at his door, a court order in hand. They then raided his apartment. Weddle was being investigated for treason and espionage. The 30-hour ordeal ended with Weddle being ordered to board a plane to Miami. And Cody Weddle joins us now on the line from Aventura, Fla. Welcome to the program.",

Then I opened the door, and there were those four officers there. They raided my apartment. They went through every single thing I had. They were going through my WhatsApp messages for hours and hours. They also brought in some other equipment that they said was used for a sweep. It was a bizarre-looking apparatus that shot out a laser. And they pointed it at my walls and at the air conditioning unit. And they said they were looking for spying equipment.",

I did speak to - anonymously to some sources within the armed forces - within the security forces, rather, about how they are affected by the economic crisis. And what I already knew, and what I confirmed through that reporting, was that a large portion of Venezuela's security forces are suffering the effects of this economic crisis. While they would like to see a change, they can't do anything because of intense internal surveillance. Also, I think I was able to even further confirm that reporting through this experience and getting an inside look at one of those security forces. These were military counterintelligence officials. And it was very clear that this whole procedure was improvised in many ways. Even in my apartment, when they had to take my fingerprints, they didn't have ink. So they broke one of my pens, and they were spreading out the ink from the pen in a bottle cap. And that's how we did the fingerprints. And I had reported that some security officials are being asked to contribute part of their already measly salaries to buy paper for the office.",
