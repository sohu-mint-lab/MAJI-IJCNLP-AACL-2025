            "previous_answer": "Yeah. I mean, and also a man who - before Donald Trump's election, Boris Johnson said that Donald Trump showed such stupefying ignorance he was unfit for office. And clearly, relations between the two men have improved since then. Donald Trump sees Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit Party that stormed to success in the recent European elections, as kindred spirits. And certainly, Boris Johnson seems to have been given permission to meet him next week on the sidelines of this visit. And I think, you know, that's certainly one reason why the government - Downing Street - is apprehensive about this visit. But I think certainly, the people are nervous in London, as any host is, I guess, ahead of a Donald Trump visit.",

Has there been any response from the palace about his nasty comment, which was, we should say, in response to President Trump being informed that Meghan Markle had called him a misogynist back when she was an actress?",
            "previous_answer": "Yeah, I don't think there's been a response to it yet - not that I've seen. And I guess, you know, it puts a cloud on it. The special relationship was given a boost by the birth of Meghan's and Prince Harry's baby. And that was seen as sort of a good omen ahead of this visit, unfortunately, now is being, obviously, overshadowed by what Donald Trump has said. That may be a prelude to what he may say about other people here. And I think the concern is that Donald Trump will use this and kind of abuse the invitation. He'll be given all the kind of welcome that he can expect in a royal visit. But is he going to return the favor, or is he going to bring up these tricky diplomatic issues, which are kind of flies in the ointment in the relationship as it currently stands?",

            "previous_answer": "Well, if you talk to diplomats that - and their answer is that these state visits are hugely important. But in the background, there's a lot of sort of diplomatic nitty-gritty going on. There's a lot of business deals being made. And the hope is that this continues to cement that relationship, which we're told is greater than the sort of personal relationship currently in the heart of it. Well, I wouldn't say that's a given. We may end up, at the end of this visit, with egg all over the government's face, Donald Trump speaking well away from the script and embarrassing its host. Or he may just enjoy the ride and, for this time, behave himself.",
