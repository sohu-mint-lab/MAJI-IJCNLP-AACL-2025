And I address that in some of these essays as well. If I opened up to him about the sexual assault that occurs in the book, perhaps we would have been closer. Perhaps things could have been different. So thinking about those what ifs and understanding that I won't find those answers, but I can still write into those questions.",

There's a reason it took 17 years to write that piece - because I had to work through that, and the box was closed.
