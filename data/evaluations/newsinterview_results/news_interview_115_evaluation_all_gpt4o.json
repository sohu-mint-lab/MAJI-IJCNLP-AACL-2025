            "previous_answer": "If you look at some of the characteristics I think that would define a successful process for impeachment and you compare that to what we saw with Director Mueller, he had more resources. He had more access to things like documents, emails. He had more access to the technical capabilities of the FBI, and he had more time. Remember; that was 2 1/2 years he spent coming to conclusions that didn't lead us too far down the path. The Democrats come at this from a partisan approach. He was nonpartisan with less time, fewer people, less technical capability. It's hard for me to see how in the next 15 months you can resolve this in a way that leaves us in the summer of 2020 looking back saying that was really good for America.",

The other is an issue that was lost mostly during the hearings last week that we should focus on that you just discussed, which is how we think about Russia. If we spend a little less time on an impeachment process that won't succeed and maybe more time talking about how we help states defend themselves and how we talk to the American people about how they look at Facebook messages next year during the campaign, I think we'd be better off.",

If you look at this in context, a man who served both Democrats and Republicans - remember; he was renominated for FBI director by a Democratic president, President Obama - a man who served honorably in Vietnam, a Princeton graduate who decided to go overseas to a war not a lot of people liked at that time, and you looked at some of the attacks he took from Republicans and some of the way he was used by Democrats, I looked at the man I served - and I know people who are listening don't know him - he was an honorable, great man. I mean, I'm 57, and I still have a hero, and that's Robert Mueller. I just don't think he was treated very well during the hearing and, by the way, afterward when people talked about his performance.",

And I thought if I didn't talk to my friends who will never speak and tell their story, try to have people - even if they don't like what we did, have people stand in our shoes, that the story, the immediacy, would be lost.

Whether you liked the program or not, the people who participated, created it - I'm not going to pass the buck. I was there. I lost my career over that program. They live next door to you.

But that reflection, I think, requires people also to step back to the spring of 2002 when we got our first prisoner and say, am I sure?
