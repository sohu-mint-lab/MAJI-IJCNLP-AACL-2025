The world's global crisis continues to deepen as high unemployment rates hits Spain, Ireland, France, and the United States. Just last week, European leaders met in Berlin to devise a plan to kick start the economy on the other side of the Atlantic. While here at home, President Barack Obama signed a $787 billion stimulus package. But how did we get here? And which nations are hurting, and which are not? Joining me now to explain more is Nariman Behravesh. He is chief economist and executive vice president of IHS Global Insight, a forecasting company that provides analysis on the world's economic and financial markets. Nariman, welcome.",

Certainly, the U.S. played a big role in it, no debate about that, and the housing bubble and the related subprime crisis that came with it were a big factor. But it wasn't the only factor. In fact, if you look at credit growth everywhere in the world - Europe, Asia, China in particular, even parts of the Middle East - that credit growth and that credit bubble were huge, arguably the biggest in history. But again, the emphasis is on global. Everybody participated in this binge, if you want to call it that, in terms of very rapid growth in credit. And it showed up, again, not just in housing in the U.S., but house prices in the U.K. shot up, Ireland, Spain, you saw stock markets in - in many emerging markets shoot up. And last but not least, we saw commodity prices shoot up. So, these were all bubbles that were inflated by this global sort of credit binge, if you want to put it that way.",

So, you know, a lot of Asian countries that export to Europe and to the U.S. just are seeing their export orders just plummet and it's hurting them. So, they are getting hurt by this. In other parts of the emerging world, in Eastern Europe let's say in particular, there it's much more this credit crunch where these are countries that have borrowed a lot, borrowed a lot in dollars and Euros and Swiss francs, and they're getting clobbered by now high interest rates and this tightening up of credit that's occurring worldwide.",

These are big problems that have been in the making for a long, long time because of an economy that's been run into the ground. But more generally, Africa and Latin America are being hurt, but it doesn't seem quite as bad for example, as those in Eastern Europe, their debt levels are not as high. While they're hurting some because of the big fall in commodity prices - I mean, we've seen for example the first negative growth in South Africa since 1998. But I don't think these are as hard hit because the financial exposure in this part of the world is not as great as let's say it is in the U.S. certainly, in Europe, and parts of emerging Europe.",
