We first spoke to Andrew's mother, Alyssa Black, shortly after her son's death. She was calling for Vermont to pass legislation requiring a cooling-off period between when a person can walk into a gun store and walk out with a firearm. A bill requiring a 24-hour waiting period moved to the top of the Vermont Senate's agenda earlier this year. It passed in both houses. And then last week, it was vetoed by Governor Phil Scott. Alyssa Black joins me now. Welcome to WEEKEND EDITION.",

And he said, to explain his veto, that Vermont has already enacted numerous restrictions on gun ownership, including universal background checks, a ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines, raising the legal age to purchase a gun to 21. Do you take his point that he feels that there are already quite a few restrictions?",
            "previous_answer": "Well, I know he's very proud of his accomplishments last year. In the governor's response to the veto, he didn't say one thing about this bill that he disagreed with. His only thoughts were, we did enough last year. Well, clearly we didn't do enough last year. And just because you do something one year doesn't mean that you can't do something the year after. You know, 90% of firearm deaths in the state of Vermont are suicide. Almost nothing that was done last year helps that number at all.",

And we understood that this was not easy. We were incredibly fortunate to get to the governor's desk. The Statehouse didn't want to deal with guns again. They'd had a very bitter year the year before, and nobody wanted to touch it again. The fact that we got it through the Senate and the House with broad support and got to the governor's desk, frankly, is a bit of a miracle. And we'll try again next year.
