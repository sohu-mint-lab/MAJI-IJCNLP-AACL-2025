This is a threat to the very sovereignty of the U.S. Those comments all on the developing story of a whistleblower's concerns over President Trump's dealings with foreign powers.

I think there is a very, very big leap between candidate Trump in 2016 saying, Russia, if you can hear this, show us the emails, and President Trump using his awesome powers to coerce a foreign government into interfering in our elections. You know, his defense to the Mueller report was that, yeah, Russia may have interfered but that he had nothing to do with it.
